          <p class="mega push-0 max-length">Coco’s Chocolatiers was founded over 100 years ago by Coco Delive. He started making his famous recipe at the age of 18 in his mothers kitchen. He always had a passion for baking and altering recipes to make his own specialties. When he first started out making his world famous chocolates he sold them at his high school bake sales. When they started getting recognized for how amazing they were he started to sell them at stores that would sell them for him, like some of his local corner stores. After saving enough money from sales and his grocery clerk job he rented out a small shop in the Byward Market in downtown Ottawa to make and sell them out of. After two years his business started to become very popular and generating a lot of money. As Coco’s Chocolatiers company became well known four more locations were opened in different places around the world. Come visit us and indulge in our famous mouth watering chocolates.</p>
